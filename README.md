# Programming Challenge "Amigo Secreto"

Lesson on using basic JS from Alura to change HTML tags.

## Challenge specifications ðŸŽ¯

The challenge consists on adding functionality to save names in a list and displaying it, then getting one of the names at random and displaying it as well.

For this the app.js was modified to add three functions:

âœ…``agregarAmigo()``

Saves the text written by the user in the input field to a list.

âœ…``mostrarLista()``

Displays the current list of names, after erasing the previous one if it has been displayed before. This function is called from ``agregarAmigo()`` automatically.

âœ…``sortearAmigo()``

Draws  one name from the list at random and displays it in different, more prominent text.


## Additional work: styling ðŸŽ¨

The style of the page was changed from the basic design provided. The image for the header banner was changed to a realistic one generated on Sora (OpenAI), and the CSS styling was changed to a color palette that fits it, while the layout and sizing was kept more or less the same.
